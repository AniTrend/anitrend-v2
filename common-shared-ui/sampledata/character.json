	"description": "Ruka Sarashina is one of the deuteragonists of the series. She's suffering from arrhythmia and she seeks a lover that will help her cope with her condition. She's seen as being a very pushy and possessive kind of person. This personality of hers developed after learning of her condition and being alienated from her peers. Because of this, she became very fixated on the idea that getting a boyfriend would help her in having a faster heartbeat.\n\nAlong with her rather brash personality, she doesn't like giving up easily; often making poor decisions to get what she wants.\n\n(Source: Kanojo, Okarishimasu Wiki)",
