     * * Symmetric: for any non-null values `x` and `y`, `x.equals(y)` should return true if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns true.
     * * Transitive:  for any non-null values `x`, `y`, and `z`, if `x.equals(y)` returns true and `y.equals(z)` returns true, then `x.equals(z)` should return true.
     * * Consistent:  for any non-null values `x` and `y`, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in `equals` comparisons on the objects is modified.
     * * Never equal to null: for any non-null value `x`, `x.equals(null)` should return false.
